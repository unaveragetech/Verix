# Verix - Form Submission Backup Tool

This repository contains a Python tool designed to **back up all form submissions** sent to the email address you are checking. It uses the [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co) API to retrieve submissions linked to your FormSubmit forms, ensuring you have a reliable backup of all the data sent through your forms. 

**Note**: The FormSubmit API allows only **3 full requests per 24 hours**, so be mindful of this limit when making requests.

## Features

- **Form Submission Backup**: Retrieves and saves all form submissions sent to a specific email address using the FormSubmit API.
- **Encrypted API Key Storage**: API keys are securely encrypted and stored locally using industry-standard encryption.
- **Submission Search**: Allows you to search through the submissions for specific data fields (like names or emails).
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: The entire tool runs in a CLI environment, making it easy to use and integrate with other projects.
- **User Authentication**: Provides password protection for accessing and managing submission data.

---

## How the Code Works

```bash
# 1. API Key Retrieval:
```
After providing your email, the tool requests an API key from FormSubmit. The API key is sent to the provided email address, and the user must enter it into the tool to verify ownership. The API key is then encrypted and stored locally.

```bash
# 2. Submissions Retrieval:
```
The tool uses the FormSubmit API to retrieve submissions linked to your form. The `get_submissions` function sends a GET request to the FormSubmit endpoint, fetching all forms submitted to the provided email address. The retrieved data is processed and displayed in the terminal.

```bash
# 3. Submission Search:
```
You can search through your form submissions using specific keywords. For example, if you're looking for a form submitted by "John Doe", you can enter the search term, and the tool will display all forms where this name appears.

```bash
# 4. Rate Limiting:
```
FormSubmit imposes a **limit of 3 full API requests per 24 hours**. Each request retrieves all form submissions tied to the email address. Be mindful of this restriction to avoid hitting the limit.

|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `README.md`             | Contains comprehensive project documentation, including installation instructions, usage details, features, and contribution guidelines. It also includes commands for package installation via `pip`. Users can refer to this file for an overview of the project and how to get started. For more information on FormSubmit, visit [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co). For email services, check out [Mail.com](https://www.mail.com).  |
| `cli_tool.py`          | This script serves as the command-line interface tool, enabling users to interact with the application's backup functionality. It allows users to retrieve submissions from FormSubmit and manage their data effectively through a user-friendly CLI. Example command to run the tool: `python cli_tool.py`.  |
| `email_verification.py` | Implements the email verification process for user accounts. This script sends activation emails to users, followed by a verification code. Users must enter this code in the CLI to verify their accounts. This enhances the security of the application. Example activation email function:  <br>```python<br>def send_activation_email(email):<br>    # Logic to send an email<br>```|
| `requirements.txt`      | This file lists all the Python package dependencies required to run the project. It can be used with pip to install necessary packages easily. Example command: <br>```bash<br>pip install -r requirements.txt<br>``` |
| `secret.key`            | This file securely stores the encrypted API key and password, ensuring that sensitive information is protected and not hardcoded in the code. It is essential for maintaining user data security. Example of generating a key: <br>```python<br>from cryptography.fernet import Fernet<br>key = Fernet.generate_key()<br>``` |
| `user_data.json`       | A JSON file that maintains user data, such as verified email addresses and associated submission data. This format allows for easy access and management of user information. Example structure: <br>```json<br>{<br>  "user@example.com": {<br>    "api_key": "encrypted_api_key",<br>    "password": "hashed_password"<br>  }<br>}<br>``` |

## Usage

To use the tool, run the script from the CLI. You'll be prompted for your email address and API key, and the tool will then retrieve and display your form submissions.

### Example:

```bash
python verix.py
```

#### Steps:

1. **Enter Email**: Input the email address associated with your FormSubmit forms.
2. **Retrieve API Key**: The tool will guide you through requesting an API key from FormSubmit. Check your email, and enter the API key when prompted.
3. **View or Search Submissions**: After logging in, you can choose to either view all submissions or search for specific submissions based on keywords.
4. **Logout**: When you're done, you can log out, which will securely clear your session.

#### Example Command:

```bash
python verix.py
```

**Note**: Each API key request counts toward the daily limit of 3 API requests.

## FormSubmit API Integration

The tool integrates seamlessly with FormSubmitâ€™s API to manage your form submissions. Below are some key details about how the API interaction works:

- **API Key**: Your API key is requested from FormSubmit and is used to fetch all the submissions linked to your form.
- **Request Limits**: The FormSubmit API allows up to **3 full requests per 24-hour period**. Each full request retrieves all available submissions.
- **Hidden Email**: For security purposes, the tool does not directly expose your email but uses the encrypted API key instead.
- **Form Data**: All form data, including names, emails, and messages submitted through your forms, is retrieved via the API.

---

## Code Walkthrough

```bash
# Core Functions:
```

- **`get_api_key(email)`**: This function sends a request to FormSubmit to retrieve the API key for the provided email. The key is then encrypted and stored for future use.
  
- **`get_submissions(api_key)`**: This function retrieves all submissions tied to the provided email address. It uses the encrypted API key to authenticate the request.

- **`search_submissions(api_key, search_term)`**: Allows users to search for specific data within the form submissions. This feature scans through all submissions and returns those that match the search term.

- **`encrypt_api_key(api_key)` / `decrypt_api_key(encrypted_api_key)`**: These functions handle the encryption and decryption of the API key to ensure that sensitive data is stored securely.

- **`loading_bar(duration)`**: Adds a loading bar for a smoother user experience while waiting for API requests to complete.
